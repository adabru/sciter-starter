# Sciter-Starter

A more complete templating repository can be found on: <https://github.com/ramon-mendes/SciterBootstrap> . Please use that if it suits your needs. This tool is meant to be used on Linux to create a project-template that uses the [sciter-sdk](https://sciter.com) and can be compiled for Windows (via mingw) and Linux.
